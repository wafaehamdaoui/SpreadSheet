# SpreadSheet

## Introduction:
A spreadsheet is an application for organization, analysis, and storage of data in tabular form. The first part of the project will focus on the core features and skeleton of the application . In part two we’ll take care of text-formatting ( like copy, delete, select  ). And in part three, we’ll add some useful extensions like a find and go cell dialog.

**This is what it’ll look like at the end of this project**
